# ðŸš€ First Steps into Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Hi there!  
This repository documents my first learning experience with **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, including setting up **Terraform**, **AWS**, and **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** â€” inspired by the book *Terraform: Up & Running* by **Yevgeniy Brikman**.

##  What I Learned

###  What is IaC?
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of provisioning and managing cloud resources using configuration files instead of manual processes. It allows infrastructure to be:

- **Version controlled**
- **Repeatable**
- **Automated**
- **Collaborative**

I broke this down in a beginner-friendly way in my blog post:  
 [What is IaC and Why You Should Care (Even as a Beginner)](https://medium.com/@kennyjames104/what-is-iac-and-why-you-should-care-even-as-a-beginner-43be429fba5b)

## Setting Up My Environment

While learning, I also documented my setup process step-by-step â€” from creating an AWS account to running Terraform in VSCode:

- Installed Terraform locally
- Installed and configured AWS CLI
- Set up Visual Studio Code with the AWS Toolkit
- Wrote and ran my first Terraform script

##  Resources That Helped

-  *Terraform: Up & Running* by Yevgeniy Brikman
-  HashiCorp Documentation (https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform)
-  AWS Docs & Free Tier (https://aws.amazon.com/free)

## What's Next?

- Practice writing reusable Terraform modules
- Learn about remote state and backend configuration
- Explore deploying full stacks using Terraform + AWS
