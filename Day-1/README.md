#  First Steps into Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

This project documents my **first experience learning Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, inspired by reading  
 *Terraform: Up & Running* by Yevgeniy Brikman.

As a beginner in the cloud and DevOps space, this journey helped me understand how IaC simplifies infrastructure management by allowing us to **define, deploy, and manage cloud resources using code** — instead of manually clicking around cloud dashboards.

##  What I Learned

- **What is IaC?**
  - IaC lets you manage and provision your infrastructure using code files.
  - It ensures **consistency**, **repeatability**, and **version control** for cloud environments.

- **Why IaC is Important:**
  -  Automates deployments
  -  Makes environments reproducible
  -  Integrates easily with version control (e.g., Git)
  -  Reduces human error

- **Getting Hands-On with Terraform:**
  - Set up AWS CLI & credentials
  - Installed Terraform locally
  - Wrote my first `main.tf` file to provision AWS resources
  - Learned how to use `terraform init`, `plan`, and `apply` effectively

##  My IaC Write-Up

I wrote a beginner-friendly blog post breaking down IaC and its benefits — perfect for those just getting started.

##  Tools Used

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- AWS Free Tier Account

##  What's Next?

I plan to:
- Dive deeper into Terraform modules and state management
- Learn more about CI/CD integrations with IaC
- Explore real-world infrastructure deployments across multiple environments
